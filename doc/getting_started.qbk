[section Getting started]

[heading Getting the source]

[h5 Prepackaged distributions]

You can get the latest prepackaged distribution online:

* [@http://www.leonmergen.com/downloads/libpaxos-cpp-0.6.0.tar.gz]

Alternatively, you can [@http://www.leonmergen.com/downloads/ browse older releases].

[h5 Github]

You can obtain the source directly from the [@http://github.com/solatis/libpaxos-cpp github repository]:

  git clone git@github.com:solatis/libpaxos-cpp.git

Keep in mind that building directly from the source repository requires you to have the autotools environment ready on your server.

[heading Dependencies]

All of this applies only to a Unix-like environment. Windows with cygwin will perhaps work, but is not tested. Libpaxos-cpp depends upon the following tools:

* [@http://www.boost.org/ Boost.org] libraries, version 1.49 or higher;
* GCC version 4.5 or higher (C++11 support is required).

[note GCC version 4.4 is known to generate internal compiler errors and therefore at least version 4.5 is recommended.]

[note clang++ version 3.0 is known to generate internal compiler errors due to very limited lambda support. Version 3.1 might work but is untested.]

[heading Building libpaxos-cpp]

libpaxos-cpp follows the normal autotools flow of installing libraries:

  wget http://www.leonmergen.com/download/libpaxos-cpp-VERSION.tar.gz
  tar -xzf libpaxos-cpp-VERSION.tar.gz
  cd libpaxos-cpp-VERSION
  ./configure --enable-sqlite
  make
  make check
  make install

You can optionally choose to not --enable-sqlite, although that means the [link libpaxos_cpp.eventual_consistency eventual consistency properties] of libpaxos-cpp are lost.

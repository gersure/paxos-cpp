  \brief Ensures that commands are dispatched to the proper handler

  In our traffic flow, we support the pipelining of multiple commands simultaneously over the same
  connection. This means that we need to do some kind of state tracking: replies to commands do not
  necessarily have to be received in the same order as they arrived.

  This class keeps track of this state. It ensures every command is associated with an id, and
  if a reply to a specific command is expected, waits until this reply is given (or a timeout).
